## PyBoss
Created a new HR system, which requires employee records be stored completely different with what we had in a data file.

currently data files hold employee records like the below:

Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania

It converted and exported the data to use the following format instead:

Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA
